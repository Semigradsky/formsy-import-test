# formy-import-test 
Just some code to replicate an issue im having with using the formsy-react library.

I'm not entirely familiar with some to use the nodejs,
but running any server from the root of the directory will show the error in the debug console.

I just use a simple python server to get things going here.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090
```

**Note**: If you uncomment the **formsy-react** import, then the plain reactjs app will run just fine.
